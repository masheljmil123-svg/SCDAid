SCDAid – Genotype & Renal-Aware VOC Pain Decision Support Tool
Clinical decision support for acute vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) integrating genetics, renal function, weight, and pain severity.

The Clinical Problem
* Delayed initiation of analgesia in emergency settings
* Variability in analgesic selection and dosing
* Renal impairment is not consistently integrated into dosing decisions
* CYP2D6 phenotype–drug mismatch (codeine/tramadol safety concerns)
* Risk of under-treatment or adverse effects due to fragmented decision inputs
Patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) experiencing VOC require rapid, safe, and structured pain management.

The SCDAid Approach
SCDAid is a prototype clinical decision support tool that integrates:
* Patient weight
* Estimated GFR (renal function)
* Pain severity
* CYP2D6 phenotype (if available)
The tool generates a structured multimodal analgesic recommendation that may include:
* Opioid options (when clinically indicated)
* Non-opioid options (e.g., paracetamol; NSAIDs when renal function permits)
* Renal dose considerations
* CYP2D6-related precautionary flags (e.g., codeine/tramadol avoidance when relevant)
* Safety reminders

Intended Clinical Contribution
SCDAid is designed to:
* Support more consistent analgesic decision-making
* Highlight renal considerations during drug selection
* Flag genotype-related safety concerns
* Facilitate structured multimodal VOC pain planning
It is not a replacement for clinical judgment, but a decision support aid.

Added Value
Unlike simple dose calculators, SCDAid integrates:
Genotype + Renal Function + Weight + Pain Severity
into a single structured recommendation output to assist clinicians during acute VOC assessment.
