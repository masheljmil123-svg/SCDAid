SCDAid – Genotype-Informed VOC Pain Decision Tool
3-second precision analgesia with genetic + renal safety guardrails

The Clinical Problem
- Delayed analgesia in emergency departments
- Variability in opioid dosing
- Renal impairment is not consistently considered
- CYP2D6 phenotype mismatch (codeine/tramadol risk)
- Increased risk of respiratory depression or treatment failure

Sickle Cell VOC patients require rapid, safe, and standardized analgesia.

The SCDAid Solution

SCDAid integrates:

- Patient Weight (kg)
- eGFR (renal function)
- Pain Severity
- CYP2D6 Phenotype (if available)
- 
- And generates:

✔️ Weight-based opioid dosing  
✔️ Renal dose adjustment  
✔️ Genotype-informed opioid selection  
✔️ NSAID safety check  

Clinical Impact

- Standardized emergency prescribing
- Reduced renal dosing errors
- Avoids CYP2D6-related opioid mismatch
- Faster time-to-analgesia
- Precision medicine approach in acute care
Added Value

Unlike simple dose calculators, SCDAid combines:

Genotype + Renal Function + Weight + Severity  
Into one real-time clinical decision.
